# DysnomiaOS
This is a project I made, mainly for fun, but also as an extra feature for another project I'm working on!


## Installation
Clone the repo, make the installer and then run the installer with the path you want to install it to.
```
git clone https://github.com/kxtzownsu/DysnomiaOS
make installer
./build/inst/installer -i <path> (-s if you want to skip bootanim)
```

## Running the OS
